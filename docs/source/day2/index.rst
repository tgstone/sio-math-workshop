Day 2
======

Welcome to the second day of the math workshop! Lunch today will be provided right
outside NH101 by the Dollar Lunch Club (Lunch costs 1$ if you are able; they have Venmo!).
After the workshop, there will be a pizza party on the beach! We will walk everyone down
after the last class, but if you are meeting us there: go to the CCS building (directly right of
the pier) and walk down the ramp to the beach.
