    "\n",
    "The goal here is to try to build a bit of intuition for Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors, as well as to provide some light motivation for why we might use them to solve differential equations. Linear algebra is heavy on theorems, which I think is why it can often seem boring. Proofs will be skipped here, in favor of intuitive arguments when they exist and declarations of fact otherwise. These notes may be heavy on jargon, but paired with the in person lecture they will hopefully be useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's think about a linear transformation $A$ on an abstract arbitrary vector $\\vec{v}$. This can be represented by the equation $A \\vec{v} = \\vec{v ^\\prime}$. Let us assume that $A$ transforms vectors from a vector space onto itself. This operation is doable if, for example, we have the matrix form of $A$, and is even quite simple if $A$ has not too many dimensions. As an example, let\n",

Eigenvalues and eigenvectors have a few uses, but for me an essential use case is making computations that would be otherwise hard/impossible into computations that are easier/doable using diagonalization.

    "This exercise is clearly more work than it was to just do the computation, so why bother diagonalizing? The gain mostly comes when it is tricky or impossible to represent $A$ as a matrix, such as in infinite-dimensional vector spaces. One example is in ODEs. The n'th derivative operation is a linear transformation on the vector space of infinitely differentiable functions. Exponentials are eigenvalues of the first derivative operator, since $\\frac{d}{dx}e^{kx}=k e^{kx}.$\n",
    "-  Exercise: Think of some functions which are eigenvectors of the second derivative operator and are not exponentials.\n",
    "This gets us to a method of solving ODEs which comes up in Applied Math 1. If we have a way to write a function in a vector space where the relevant differential operator is diagonal, we can turn a differential equation into an algebraic one. I will work through an example in class if we have time."
