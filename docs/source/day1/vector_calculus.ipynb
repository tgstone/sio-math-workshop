    "\n",
    "The divergence theorem states that, for a conservative quantity, the\n",
    "divergence integrated over a volume is equal to the flux through the\n",
    "volume’s surface. In plain language, it states that a change in the\n",

    "\\end{gather*}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The divergence theorem becomes especially useful when we can say that\n",
    "the change in a quantity is zero. In oceanography, we can usually treat\n",
    "water as incompressible. This means that the total mass of water in a\n",
    "volume will not change. This leads to a useful form of mass continuity,\n",
