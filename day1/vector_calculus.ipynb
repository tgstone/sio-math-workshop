    "$\\mathbf{f}(x, y)$, the surface integral is $$\\begin{gather*}\n",
    "    \\oint_S \\mathbf{f}(x, y)\\ \\cdot \\ \\mathrm{d}S = \\oint_S \\mathbf{f}(x, y)\\ \\cdot \\mathbf{\\hat{n}} \\ \\mathrm{d}S\n",
    "\\end{gather*}$$ So you instead evaluate the dot product of the vector\n",

    "## Divergence Theorem\n",
    "\n",
    "The divergence theorem states that, for a conservative quantity, the\n",
    "divergence integrated over a volume is equal to the flux through the\n",
    "volume’s surface. In plain language, it states that a change in the\n",
    "quantity inside of a volume has to be equal to the amount that left or\n",

    "\\end{gather*}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The divergence theorem becomes especially useful when we can say that\n",
    "the change in a quantity is zero. In oceanography, we can usually treat\n",
    "water as incompressible. This means that the total mass of water in a\n",
    "volume will not change. This leads to a useful form of mass continuity,\n",
