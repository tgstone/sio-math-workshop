    "In previous sections, we were introduced to a few techniques for estimating functions. Fourier Series, and by extension, Fourier Analysis, is a natural extension of the Taylor Expansion. The primary difference is that the Fourier Series is ideal for *Periodic* functions, while Taylor Expansion is usable for any function, around some point.\n",
    "\n",
    "From an application standpoint, Fourier Analysis is particularly useful because of the prevalence of periodic signals of many natural phenomena that many of us will encounter. Waves are often the most visible form of periodic signals we see in oceanography, but are not the only ones. Fourier analysis is a fairly content-dense topic that a single 45-minute lecture would have a hard time summarizing well, so for the purposes of this workshop, we will focus on building your intuition for approaching these problems."

    "This is a concise form of the Fourier Series, but let's take a second to think about this. Here are some checkpoint questions to make sure you understand before we go deeper.\n",

    "1. **What do the coefficient terms ($a_0$, $a_n$ & $b_n$) describe?**\n",
    "   \n",
    "     The coefficients describe the relative weight of each component towards the reconstruction of $f(x)$.\n",
    "2. **Why do we need a separate cosine and sine term?**\n",
    "\n",
    "    This comes from a really useful trig identity. We normally might express a wave like this: $f(x) = cos(kx + \\phi)$ or $f(t) = cos(\\omega t + \\phi)$. This details a wave that is either space ($kx$) or time ($\\omega t$) varying, with a phase offset term. That phase offset is the part that we care about in this instance, and the reason we end up needing both components. If we use the trig identity $cos(A + B) = cos(A)cos(B) - sin(A)sin(B)$, we can accurately represent the phase of a single wave mode, with a zero phase sine and cosine component instead.\n",
    "3. **What are the bounds of the interval as written?**\n",
    "\n",
    "   In this particular case, the bounds are over all values of $0 \\le n \\le \\infty$. However, it is often the case that it is easier, or necessary, to enforce bounds that are relevant to the period of our function."

The period is inversely proportional to the frequency( or wavenumber) of our waves. i.e. $T = \\frac{1}{f}$ or $L = \\frac{1}{x}$.\n",

    "The Fourier Transform is the next step past the series. There are typically 2 flavors of the FT that exist, and it is dependent on the type of signal you have. The first option is the continuous Fourier transform (CFT), which is reliant on having a continuous data stream that can be broken up into an infinite number of discrete frequencies. The other option is the discrete Fourier transform (DFT), which is tailored toward discrete data and frequencies. In science, we will mostly utilize the DFT, since this is more like how our sampled signals will actually look like a set of discrete data points, spaced by a uniform (ideally) time step that is defined by our sensors."

We use the FT to get a sense of what sort of frequencies of things we are seeing, and how they contribute to the measured signal as a whole. The FT can be massaged into a more usuable form, that we call the Spectrum.
