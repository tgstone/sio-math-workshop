However, it’s important to note that\nthese can be represented by any character. For example, one of the most\ncommon is $x$ being the dependent variable and $t$ being the independent\nvariable, especially in physical, time-dependent problems.  \n  \nIn these notes, I use the notation $\\frac{dy}{dx}$ to represent a\nderivative of $y(x)$ with respect to $x$. However, the notation $y'(x)$ and $y_{x}$\nare often used. Here we would write $\\frac{d^2y}{dx^2}$ as $y''(x)$ and $y_{xx}$. In\nthis case, some high $n^{th}$ derivative of $y$, written here as\n$\\frac{d^ny}{dx^n}$ is written as $y^{(n)}(x)$ and $y_{x...x}$.  \n  \nIn time-dependent problems, the derivative of a function with respect to\ntime is often written as $\\dot{x}(t)$, with higher derivatives\nincreasing the number of dots (up to a reasonable point, before\n$x^{(n)}(t)$ is used), so a second derivative is written as\n$\\ddot{x}(t)$.\n\n## 2 | Classification of ODEs\n\n### 2.1 What is an ODE?\n\nAn ordinary differential equation is an equation that relates the\nderivative(s) ($\\frac{dy}{dx}$) of the dependent variable (y) to some\nfunction of the the independent variable (x) and dependent variable\nitself (y(x)): $$\\frac{dy}{dx} = F(x,y).$$\n\nThe word ‘ordinary’ means that the differential equation dependent on\n**only** a single independent variable (x), in contrast to partial\ndifferential equations (PDEs) that is respect to **more** than one\nindependent variable (x, y, z...).\n\n### 2.2 Order of an ODE\n\nThe order of an ODE refers to the highest derivative of the function\npresent in the equation. For example,\n\n$$\\frac{d^{2}y}{dx^2} +\\frac{dy}{dx} +y(x) = 0$$ is **second order**,\nbecause the highest derivative, $\\frac{d^2y}{dx^2}$, is the second\nderivative of the function $y(x)$.\n$$\\frac{d^{5}y}{dx^5} +4\\frac{dy}{dx} +y(x) = 0$$ is **fifth order**,\nbecause the highest derivative is the fifth derivative of $y(x)$.\n\n### 2.3 Linear vs Non-linear ODEs\n\nA linear ODE is linear in the dependent variable, $y(x)$, and all of its\nderivatives. This means that the dependent variable $y(x)$ cannot have a\npower that isn’t one or zero, and nor can any of its derivatives. The\ndependent variable and its derivatives also cannot multiply or divide\neach other. The general form of an $n^{th}$-order linear ODE is:\n$$A_n(x) \\frac{d^ny}{dx^n} + A_{n-1}(x) \\frac{d^{n-1}y}{dx^{n-1}} + ... + A_2(x) \\frac{d^2y}{dx^2} + A_1(x) \\frac{dy}{dx} + A_0(x) y(x) = f(x).$$\nIt is important to notice that the functions\n${A_n(x), A_{n-1}(x), ... , A_2(x), A_1(x), A_0(x)}$ do not depend on\nthe dependent variable or any of its derivatives. These are arbitrary\nfunctions of $x$. Although it would make it hard to solve, it can still\nbe linear even if these functions are exponential, trigonometric,\nhyperbolic, or anything else, so long as they are only functions of\n$x$.  \n  \nIn general, most ODEs you’ll be able to solve analytically (meaning, by\nhand) are linear (though certainly not all linear ODEs can be solved\nanalytically!). There are some exceptions though!  \n  \nOn the other hand, a non-linear ODE violates these rules. For example,\nit may have the dependent variable and/or its derivatives raised to a\npower of two or more, or it could have any or all of the functions\n${A_n(x), A_{n-1}(x), ... , A_2(x), A_1(x), A_0(x)}$ depend on $y$ or\nits derivatives.\n\n### 2.4 Homogeneous vs Inhomogeneous ODEs\n\nA homogeneous ODE is an ODE for which $y = 0$ is a solution. In\npractice, this means that a homogeneous ODE does not contain any\nfunction of $x$ that is not multiplied by a function of $y$ or its\nderivatives. For example, $$\\frac{d^2y}{dx^2} + y = 0,$$ is a\nhomogeneous ODE. But, $$\\frac{d^2y}{dx^2} + y + \\sin(x)= 0,$$ is an\ninhomogeneos ODE. A homogeneous ODE is usually written in a form so that\nthe right hand side is 0. This means that every term on the left hand\nside is a function of $y$, its derivatives, and $x$, but none are\nfunctions of $x$ alone.  \n  \nAn inhomogeneous ODE is usually written with the function of $x$ alone\n(this function is referred to as the forcing) on the right hand side.\nFor example, the inhomogeneous example from before would be written as:\n$$\\frac{d^2y}{dx^2} + y= -\\sin(x),$$ where $-\\sin(x)$ is the forcing.\nHowever, of course, ODEs aren’t always written in this form, but it’s\noften how you’ll see them in practice.  \n  \nAs a quick exercise, let’s classify the following ODEs:\n$$\\frac{d^{2}y}{dx^2} +4\\frac{dy}{dx} +3y(x) = 0$$\n$$x\\frac{dy}{dx} + 4y(x) = \\frac{\\cos(x)}{x^3}$$\n$$e^x\\frac{d^{3}y}{dx^3} +4\\sin(x)\\frac{dy}{dx} +x^2y(x) = 0$$\n$$yx\\frac{d^{2}y}{dx^2} +4\\frac{dy}{dx} +y(x) = 0$$\n$$\\frac{dy}{dx} - \\tan(x)y = e^x$$ $$(\\frac{dy}{dx})^2 +y(x) = 0$$\n$$\\arcsin(x)e^x\\frac{d^{5}y}{dx^5} +4\\cosh(x)e^{x^2-x^3}\\sin(x)\\frac{dy}{dx} + y(x) = 0$$\n$$\\frac{dy}{dx} = y+x^2y$$ $$(\\frac{dy}{dx})^2  = y^2$$\n\n## 3 | An Introduction to Solving ODEs\n\nMany ODEs cannot be solved analytically. For those taking Janet’s class,\nyou’ll go through a lot of different solution strategies, but a few are\nassumed to be known at the beginning of the class. I’ll go through these\nbriefly today.\n\n### 3.1 Boundary and Initial Conditions\n\nAn ODE is incomplete without specifying boundary or initial conditions.\nWithout these conditions, you can only solve an $n^{th}$-order ODE up to\n$n$ arbitrary constants (this is called the general solution to the\nODE). These constants can be specified by applying $n$ boundary or\ninitial conditions.  \n  \nNote that a total of n conditions are required to solve n-th order\nODEs.  \n  \nBoundary conditions are when the dependent variable is specified at $n$\nvalues of the independent variable. For example, for a second order ODE,\nthe boundary conditions are $y(a) = A, \\ \\ y(b) = B$. In order to apply\nthese conditions, you first need to find the general solution to the\nODE, and then find $y(a), \\ y(b)$ in terms of the two arbitrary\nconstants, and then solve for the constant by setting them equal to $A$\nand $B$ respectively.  \n  \nInitial conditions for an $n^{th}$ order ODE specify the value of the\ndependent variable and its next $n-1$ derivatives at $t=0$. For a first\norder ODE, for example, this is simply specifying $y(0) = A$. For a\nsecond order ODE, $y(0) = A, \\ y'(0) = B$ must both be specified in\norder to obtain an exact solution.\n\n### 3.2 First Order ODEs\n\nThere are many approaches to solving first order ODEs. Today we’ll look\nonly at the two most common strategies, separation and integrating\nfactor.\n\n#### 3.2.1 Separable First Order ODEs\n\nThe simplest way to solve an ODE is to separate so that the LHS is only\na function of $y$, multiplied by $\\frac{dy}{dx}$ and the RHS is only a\nfunction of $x$. However, this only works for a special kind of first\norder ODE called separable. These can be written in the form\n$$f(y)\\frac{dy}{dx} = g(x).$$ The solution strategy for solving this\nkind of ODE is as follows:  \n  \n1. Separate the ODE into the form above  \n  \n2. \"Multiply\" both sides by $dx$ (in general, its heinous to refer to\nthis as multiplication. $dx$ is an infinitesimal quantity that\napproaches 0, and so formally you cannot multiply through an equation by\n$dx$, however, in this case only, it’s easiest to do this as if you\ncan). Now you have an equation of the form $$f(y)dy = g(x)dx$$.  \n  \n3. Integrate both sides! After integrating, you have the general\nsolution to the ODE. $$\\int f(y) dy = \\int g(x) dx$$  \n  \n4. Apply the initial/boundary condition to specify the constant of\nintegration. What is left is the exact solution to the ODE.  \n  \n**Example:** $\\frac{dy}{dx} + \\sin(x)y = 0$, subject to the initial\ncondition $y(0) = 5e$  \n  \n1. To get this in separable form, we can move the second term to the\nRHS, and then divide both sides by $y$. This becomes:\n$$\\frac{1}{y} \\frac{dy}{dx} = -\\sin(x)$$  \n  \n2. \"Multiply\" by $dx$: $$\\frac{1}{y} dy = -\\sin(x) dx$$  \n  \n3. Integrate!\n$$\\int \\frac{1}{y} dy = \\int -\\sin(x) dx \\Rightarrow \\ln{y} = \\cos(x) +C \\\\ \\\\ \\Rightarrow y = e^{\\cos(x) + C} = e^C e^{\\cos(x)} = A e^{\\cos(x)}$$  \n  \n4. Apply the initial condition:\n$$y(0) = Ae^{cos(0)} = Ae = 5e \\Rightarrow A = 5$$ and now we have the\nsolution: $$y = 5e^{\\cos(x)}.$$\n\n#### 3.2.2 Integrating Factor\n\nThis is the most useful method for solving first order ODEs, as it can\nalways be used for any linear first order ODE. The trick is to find a\nfunction of $x$ that you can multiply the whole equation by so that it\ncan be directly integrated.  \n  \nNote, the ODE (except in very few cases) must be linear for this to\nwork. This means it can be written in the form:\n$$\\frac{dy}{dx} + P(x)y = Q(x),$$ for some functions of $x$ only $P(x)$\nand $Q(x)$.  \n  \nThe solution strategy for the integrating factor method is as follows:  \n  \n1. Find the integrating factor. The integrating factor can be found by\nfinding $$\\mu(x) = e^{\\int P(x) dx}.$$ Note that in this case, we don’t\nneed a constant of integration.  \n  \n2. Multiply the ODE through by the integrating factor:\n$$\\mu(x) \\frac{dy}{dx} + \\mu(x)P(x)y = \\mu(x) Q(x).$$ Due to the form of\nthe integrating factor, this can ALWAYS be written as\n$$\\frac{d}{dx}(\\mu(x)y) = \\mu(x)Q(x).$$ because\n$\\frac{d\\mu}{dx} = \\mu(x)P(x)$ by definition.  \n  \n3. Integrate! $$y = \\mu^{-1}(x) \\left[A+\\int \\mu(x) Q(x) dx \\right]$$  \n  \n4. Specify the constant of integration with the initial or boundary\ncondition.  \n  \n**Example**: $3x\\frac{dy}{dx} + y = x^3 + x^2$ subject to\n$y(1) = \\frac{17}{70}$  \n  \n1. Find the integrating factor: here, we need to rearrange to put it in\nthe correct form. dividing by $3x$, we get\n$\\frac{dy}{dx} + \\frac{y}{3x} = \\frac{1}{3}(x^2 + x)$.\n\n$P(x) = \\frac{1}{3x}$, so we can find $\\mu(x)$ by\n$$\\mu(x) = e^{\\int P(x) dx} = e^{\\int \\frac{1}{3x} dx} = e^{\\frac{1}{3}\\ln{x}} = e^{\\ln{x}^{\\frac{1}{3}}} = x^{\\frac{1}{3}}.$$  \n  \n2. Multiply through by the integrating factor: using the trick outlined\nin step 2 above (where $Q(x) = \\frac{1}{3} (x^2+x)$), we can immediately\nwrite\n$$\\frac{d}{dx}(y x^{\\frac{1}{3}}) = \\frac{1}{3}(x^{\\frac{7}{3}}+x^{\\frac{4}{3}})$$  \n  \n3. Integrate:\n$$yx^{\\frac{1}{3}} = \\frac{1}{10}x^{\\frac{10}{3}} + \\frac{1}{7}x^{\\frac{7}{3}} + A \\Rightarrow y = \\frac{1}{10} x^3 + \\frac{1}{7}x^2 + C$$  \n  \n4. Specify the constant of integration with the initial condition:\n$$y(1) = \\frac{17}{70}+C = \\frac{17}{70}  \\Rightarrow y = \\frac{1}{10} x^3 + \\frac{1}{7}x^2.$$\n\n### 3.3 Second Order ODEs\n\n#### 3.3.1 Classification (again)\n\nHere, we are only going to look at linear, homogeneous ODEs with\nconstant coefficients. This means that the ODE can be written in the\nform: $$A\\frac{d^2y}{dx^2} +B\\frac{dy}{dx}+ Cy = 0,$$ where $A, B, C$\nare all constants. This is called a constant coefficient second order\nODE (and in this case, it’s also homogeneous and linear).\n\n#### 3.3.2 Solution by Ansatz\n\nFor linear, constant coefficient, second order ODEs, the easiest way to\nfind a solution is by making a guess. This is called the \"ansatz\". For\nconstant coefficient, we ALWAYS make the guess that $y \\propto e^{sx}$\nfor some unknown constant $s$. The solution strategy is as follows:  \n  \n1. Sub the ansatz $y \\propto e^{sx}$ into the ODE, and divide through by\n$e^{sx}$. There should be no $x$s left in the equation, it will be a\nquadratic in $s$. This is called the characteristic equation of the\nODE.  \n  \n2. Solve the characteristic equation for $s$, which should have two\nsolutions. There are three cases:  \n  \n(i) the characteristic equation has two real distinct roots.  \n  \n(ii) the characteristic equation has a repeated root.  \n  \n(iii) the characteristic equation has two roots that are a complex\nconjugate pair.  \n  \n3. (i) If the characteristic equation has two distinct real roots,\n$s = a_1, a_2$, then the general solution to the ODE is\n$$y = C_1e^{a_1x} + C_2e^{a_2x}.$$  \n  \n3. (ii) If the characteristic equation has a single repeated root,\n$s = a$ then the general solution to the ODE is\n$$y = C_1 e^{ax} + C_2 x e^{ax}.$$  \n  \n3. (iii) If the characteristic equation has a complex conjugate pair of\nroots $s = a+ib, a-ib$, then the general solution to the ODE is\n$$y = e^{ax}(C_1\\sin(bx) + C_2\\cos(bx)).$$  \n  \n4. Use the initial or boundary conditions to solve for $C_1$ and $C_2$\nand thus the exact solution.  \n  \n**Example**: $\\frac{d^2y}{dx^2} + 4\\frac{dy}{dx} + 5y = 0$, subject to\n$y(0) = 3, \\ \\ y(\\pi/2) = e^{-\\pi}$  \n  \n1. Sub in the ansatz: $s^2e^{sx} + 4se^{sx} + 5e^{sx} = 0$, and divide\nby $e^{sx}$: $s^2 + 4s + 5 = 0$ is our characteristic equation.  \n  \n2. Solve for $s$: using the quadratic formula, we obtain\n$s = -2 \\pm i$.  \n  \n3. Since we have a complex conjugate pair, the general solution is given\nby (iii): $$y = e^{-2x}(C_1\\sin(x) + C_2\\cos(x)).$$  \n  \n4. Use the BCs to solve for $C_1$ and $C_2$:\n$$y(0) = C_2 = 3, y(\\pi/2) = e^{-\\pi}(C_1) = e^{-\\pi} \\Rightarrow C_1 = 1$$\nso, we have the solution: $$y = e^{-2x}(\\sin(x) + 3\\cos(x)).$$",
