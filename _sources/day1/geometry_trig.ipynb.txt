    "Dimensional analysis is the process of tracking the base dimensions and their units in the different quantities in a mathematical expression as we do calculations with them. This can be as simple as converting a quantity from one unit to another, but gets more complicated when we have multiple quantities, sometimes in uncompatible units, within an expression."

Be aware that it gets more complicated when we work with data and need to be more exact in our conversions (not ignoring leap years and such). Programming languages typically have built-in functions to help with working with date/time data, as described [here for Matlab](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/date-and-time-operations.html) and [here for Python](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html)\n",

You may also see density values ranging from 20 to 30 instead, when the density of freshwater (1000) has been subtracted.
