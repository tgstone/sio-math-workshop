    "To simplify an arithmetic expression using PEMDAS, complete the mathematical operations in the order described above. To simplify an algebraic equation, apply PEMDAS in reverse order. Note that the order in which the addition/subtraction operations are completed is often interchangeable. The same is true for multiplication/division. When in doubt, however, the rule is to work from left to right."

    "$$\n",
    "a x^2 + b x + c = 0, \\tag{2}\n",

    "\n",
    "Recall that polynomials always have the same number of solutions as the degree on the leading order term (i.e. the unknown variable with the largest exponent). This means that a quadratic equation has two solutions, called roots. These roots may be (1) real and distinct, (2) real and repeated, or (3) a pair of complex conjugates. We’ll stick to real solutions here.\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $x_+$ and $x_-$ are positive and negative roots, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "To apply the quadratic formula, manipulate the given equation so that it looks like (2). Identify constants $a, b, c$, and substitute into (3). Lastly, simplify as much as possible.\n",
