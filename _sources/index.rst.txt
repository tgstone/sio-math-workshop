Welcome to the SIO Math Workshop!
=================================

The Math Workshop is a student-hosted program designed to welcome and support incoming students as they begin their academic journey. 
This workshop is offered as a refresher and introduction to mathematical concepts and problems you will encounter in your first year courses.

Over the course of the workshop, participants will:
* Work through interactive examples, including Jupyter notebooks with guided exercises.
* Build connections with peers and student mentors who have recently taken these same courses.

The workshop is open to all incoming students, regardless of prior preparation. Our goal is to create a welcoming, collaborative environment where students can build confidence and curiosity in mathematics before classes begin.

By the end of the program, participants will have:
* A clearer sense of what to expect in first-year math courses.
* A set of study resources and practice materials they can revisit.
* A stronger connection to the campus math community.
