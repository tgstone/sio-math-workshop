    "According to a review by **Orlando Merino, \"A Short History of Complex Numbers\" (2006)**, the need for complex numbers arose from solving cubic equations, instead of quadratic equations. <br>\n",
    "Al-Khwarizmi (780-850), a scientist of Baghdad, was one of the first to find geometric-based solutions to quadratics, but would only consider the positive roots.  When Arabic methods traveled to Italy, Leonardo da Pisa (streetname Fibonacci, 1170-1250), was able to perform for the emperor the solutions to many cubic equations.  <br>\n",
    "Gerolamo Cardano's friend Antonio Maria Fiore wins a math battle and shares his secrets from his teacher Scipione del Ferro with him. Cardano was able to back out the winning formula and published it in \"Ars Magna\" (1545). The book featured complex numbers of the form $a + \\sqrt{-b}$, of which Cardano wrote as being \"mental tortures\" to deal with.  <br>\n",
    "Later, Rafael Bombelli finds the imaginary unit, $\\sqrt{-1}$ in \"l'Algebra\" (1572, 1579) and calles it \"piรน di meno.\" <br>\n",
    "Renรฉ Descarts (1596-1650) coins the term imaginary, John Wallis (1616-1703) comes later with the geometric interpretation of i, and Euler (1707-1783) drops the banger \n",
